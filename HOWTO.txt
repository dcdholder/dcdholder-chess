For now, use the following format for initial game config:
${whitePlayerType}-${blackPlayerType}
ex. h-r to play in (h)uman vs. (r)ngAi mode
The possible options for player type at the moment are (h)uman, (r)ngAi (selects a random legal move), (o)nePlyAi (basic greedy AI which takes pieces when it can, plays random moves otherwise)
Until I get the PGN parser working, use the following move format for CLI play:
${initialFileChar}${initialRankNum}-${destFileChar}${destRankNum}
ex. a2-a3 to move the leftmost white pawn one square from starting position
Enter 'q' at any time to quit.

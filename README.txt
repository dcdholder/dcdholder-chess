This is my stab at writing a chess engine in Java.
I want the AI to be able to play better than me, which isn't too high of a target I don't think.
This will be my third attempt at writing something like this (first in C, then in C++, now in Java). Hopefully I can make it work this time.
Should help me get familiar with Java subclasses and interfaces.
Not going to win any awards.
